# modelr

native macos app for local image → 3d. both the shape and texture pipelines run in-process on [mlx swift](https://github.com/zimengxiong/hunyuan3d-swift) (no python, no pytorch, nothing leaves the machine) and render live in scenekit as they generate.

## models

modelr ships four models: one small and one large per stage. interested in integrating hunyuan3d into your app? checkout [hunyuan3d-swift](https://github.com/zimengxiong/hunyuan3d-swift)

times below are measured in-app on an M4 Max (with mesh decimation before paint).

| slot | checkpoint | notes | time |
|---|---|---|---|
| shape · small | `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mini` (0.6b) | fastest, low ram | ~52 s |
| shape · large | `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-0-turbo` (1.1b) | 8-step consistency | ~57 s |
| paint · small | `hunyuan3d-paint-v2-0` | rgb color, 2048 atlas | ~94 s |
| paint · large | `hunyuan3d-paintpbr-v2-1` | pbr (albedo + metallic-roughness), 4096 atlas | ~139 s |

## architecture!!

modelr is a simple app, but a lot of time went into designing a nice architecture for it, since generation, downloading, and painting take a lot of time, everything is designed to be responsive, including cancellations, no hung processes 😁. modelr is built around a single pure reducer: `reduce(state, event) -> (state', [Effect])`,
so the entire transition table (onboarding, downloads, shape, paint, cancel/fail edges,
stale-token protection) is unit-testable with no UI, network, or GPU. read
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for agents.
